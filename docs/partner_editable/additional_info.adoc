* On the developer console, you will be able to see your recently created application. Use this application to receive authorization from your seller using one of two authorization flows https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/guides/en-US/developer-guide/SellingPartnerApiDeveloperGuide.md#website-authorization-workflow["Website Workflow"] or https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/guides/en-US/developer-guide/SellingPartnerApiDeveloperGuide.md#self-authorization["Self-Authorization Workflow"] mentioned in the seller developer guide.

* Once you receive authorization tokens from a seller, copy the "refresh_token" and paste it in the Lambda function code on line 32.

* Click on "Deploy" to save changes to the Lambda function code.

* Click on "Test" and add some name to "Event name". Click on "Create".

== Best practices for using SP API on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

* Please refer to https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/guides/en-US/developer-guide/SellingPartnerApiDeveloperGuide.md[Selling Partner API Developer Guide] for more information about SP API setup.


== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

* The use of IAM Role in SP API is a more secure way of interacting with the APIs.
* The temporary credentials received from the IAM Role are valid for one hour. If someone gets access to the temporary credentials, it wouldnt cause much damage as it would be valid only for one hour.
