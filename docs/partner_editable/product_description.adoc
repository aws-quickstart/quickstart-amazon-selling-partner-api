This Quick Start deploys Selling Partner API integration on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. It sets up an Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and AWS Lambda function you use in your applications to call Selling Partner API endpoints.

https://developer.amazonservices.com/[Selling Partner API (SP-API)] is a suite of REST-based APIs providing Amazon Selling Partners programmatic access to their Amazon Seller Central account data. With it, you can build applications that help sellers and vendors manage their Amazon business. You must have a Professional selling plan on Amazon Seller Central and register as a developer to create Seller Central applications.
