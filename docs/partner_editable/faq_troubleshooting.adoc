== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance keeps running so that you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)
// Customize this answer if needed. For example, if you’re deploying on Linux instances, either provide the location for log files on Linux or omit the final sentence. If the Quick Start has no EC2 instances, revise accordingly (something like "and the assets keep running").

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].


== Troubleshooting

*Q.* I cannot create an app on seller central?

*A.* Once the template is deployed, you can create an app on seller central under "Develop Apps" page. If the *"Add a new app client"* button is inactive, you will first have to fill out developer profile and get it approved before creating an application.

*Q.* How do I get the refresh token to test API call?

*A.* You can either Self-Authorize your application to receive a refresh token for your seller central account. Or, you can provide an OAuth URL to your seller and request them to provide consent to your application to make API calls to their account. Please refer to "Website Authorization Workflow" in the Seller Developer Guide for more information on how to receive access and refresh tokens for a seller.

*Q.* I cant see any orders in the API response. What do I do?

*A.* If you are a third-party developer, you should receive authorization from a seller and use their refresh token to call the API. If you self-authorize your application, you would not receive any response as your seller account does not contain any orders.

*Q.* I sell in multiple marketplaces in NA, why do I only see orders for a single marketplace?

*A.* The tutorial checks which marketplaces does a seller have selling relationship in and then makes a call to get orders for the first marketplace mentioned in the list.
